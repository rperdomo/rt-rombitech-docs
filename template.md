# [Business Case]: [Primary Technologies] for [Key Outcome]

## Problem Statement

Clearly define the business problem or challenge this recipe addresses.
*Example: Many organizations struggle with disparate knowledge sources, making it difficult for employees and customers to find accurate and up-to-date information. Traditional content management systems can be costly and complex to maintain, especially for documentation-focused needs.*

## Solution Overview

Provide a high-level explanation of how the chosen technologies solve the problem. Include a simple architecture diagram or textual description if helpful.
*Example: This recipe provides a lean, developer-friendly solution by combining Just the Docs for a clean UI, Jekyll for static site generation, and GitHub Pages for free, reliable hosting. Content is written in Markdown, enabling easy version control and collaborative editing directly through Git.*

## Prerequisites

List all necessary software, accounts, and basic knowledge required. Be specific with versions if important.
* **Software:**
    * Git (latest version)
    * Ruby (version X.X.X or higher)
    * Bundler (gem install bundler)
* **Accounts:**
    * GitHub account
* **Basic Knowledge:**
    * Command Line Interface (CLI)
    * Markdown syntax
    * Git and GitHub fundamentals

## Step-by-Step Implementation

Break down the solution into logical, numbered steps. Use code blocks for commands and configuration files. Add comments for clarity.

### 1. Initialize Your Jekyll Project with Just the Docs

```bash
# Clone the Just the Docs template
git clone [https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs.github.io.git](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs.github.io.git) my-knowledge-base
cd my-knowledge-base

# Remove existing Git history if starting fresh
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of Just the Docs template"

# Install Jekyll and Bundler dependencies
bundle install
```

### 2. Configure Your Knowledge Base

Explain how to modify `_config.yml` and other key files.

```yaml
# _config.yml example
title: My Company Knowledge Base
description: Internal and External Documentation for Our Products
theme: just-the-docs

# Navigation structure example
nav_external_links:
  - title: GitHub Repository
    url: [https://github.com/your-org/my-knowledge-base](https://github.com/your-org/my-knowledge-base)
    hide_icon: false # set to true to disable the external link icon
    opens_in_new_tab: true # set to true to open this link in a new tab

# Add more configuration details as needed
```

### 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

Specific steps for setting up GitHub Pages.

* Go to your GitHub repository settings.
* Under "Pages," select the `main` branch (or `gh-pages` if you prefer a separate branch) as the source.
* Ensure the Jekyll build process is enabled (often automatic).

### 4. Test Your Knowledge Base Locally

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
# Open your browser to http://localhost:4000
```

## Key Takeaways & Best Practices

Summarize the main learnings and provide actionable advice.
* **Version Control:** Emphasize the benefits of Git for documentation.
* **Markdown Simplicity:** Highlight the ease of content creation.
* **Cost-Effectiveness:** Reinforce the free hosting aspect of GitHub Pages.
* **Scalability:** Discuss how this approach scales for documentation.
* **SEO:** Mention how static sites can be good for SEO.

## Further Enhancements

Suggest next steps or more advanced topics related to the recipe.
* Integrating with custom domains.
* Adding search functionality (e.g., Algolia, Lunr.js).
* Setting up CI/CD for automatic deployments on push.
* Implementing user authentication (if relevant).
* Using Mermaid for diagrams.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

Provide solutions for frequently encountered problems.
* **Issue:** `bundle install` fails with dependency errors.
    * **Solution:** Ensure Ruby is correctly installed and try `gem update --system` followed by `bundle install`.
* **Issue:** Pages not rendering correctly on GitHub Pages.
    * **Solution:** Check the `_config.yml` for correct `baseurl` and `url` settings, and review GitHub Pages build logs.
