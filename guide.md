Here's a suggested naming convention and standardized template, incorporating guidelines for titles, subtitles, descriptions, tags, and AI understanding:

## Naming Convention Suggestions

### 1. Recipe Title (H1)

The title should be clear, concise, and immediately convey the core solution. Aim for a pattern that includes the business case and the primary technologies involved.

* **Format:** `[Business Case]: [Primary Technologies] for [Key Outcome]`
* **Examples:**
    * `Knowledge Base: Just the Docs, Jekyll, & GitHub Pages for Collaborative Documentation`
    * `Real-time Dashboards: Apache Kafka & Apache Flink for Streaming Analytics`
    * `E-commerce Product Catalog: PostgreSQL, Elastic Stack, & Node.js for Scalable Search`
    * `Automated CI/CD Pipeline: Jenkins, Docker, & Kubernetes for Rapid Deployment`
* **Considerations:**
    * Keep it under 100 characters for better readability and search engine optimization.
    * Use ampersands (`&`) or "and" for combining technologies.
    * Capitalize proper nouns (technology names).

### 2. Subtitles (H2)

Use H2s to break down the recipe into logical sections, focusing on the "what" and "why" of each part.

* **Standard Subtitles (suggested for all recipes):**
    * `Problem Statement`
    * `Solution Overview`
    * `Prerequisites`
    * `Step-by-Step Implementation`
    * `Key Takeaways & Best Practices`
    * `Further Enhancements`
    * `Troubleshooting & Common Issues`

### 3. Description (H3 for sections, or just plain text under the title)

The description provides a high-level summary of the recipe, its benefits, and for whom it's intended.

* **Format:** Start with a brief paragraph (2-3 sentences) summarizing the recipe. Follow with bullet points or a short paragraph detailing the key benefits and target audience.
* **Example (following the H1):**
    `Knowledge Base: Just the Docs, Jekyll, & GitHub Pages for Collaborative Documentation`
    `This recipe demonstrates how to leverage a lightweight, markdown-based static site generator (Jekyll) with a clean documentation theme (Just the Docs) and free hosting (GitHub Pages) to create a robust and easily maintainable knowledge base. Ideal for small to medium-sized businesses, open-source projects, or personal documentation, this setup offers version control, collaboration features, and minimal operational overhead.`

### 4. Tags

Tags are crucial for search and categorization. Be consistent with your tag structure.

* **Format:** A comma-separated list of keywords.
* **Categories of Tags:**
    * **Business Case:** `knowledge base`, `data analytics`, `e-commerce`, `devops`, `customer support`
    * **Technologies:** `jekyll`, `github pages`, `just the docs`, `kafka`, `flink`, `postgresql`, `elastic stack`, `node.js`, `jenkins`, `docker`, `kubernetes`
    * **Concepts/Methodologies:** `static site generation`, `streaming data`, `real-time`, `microservices`, `ci/cd`, `version control`, `documentation`, `seo`
    * **Difficulty:** `beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced`
    * **Estimated Time:** `1-2 hours`, `2-4 hours`, `4-8 hours`, `>8 hours`
* **Placement:** Usually at the top or bottom of the recipe content, clearly labeled.
* **Consistency:** Maintain a master list of tags to avoid duplicates (e.g., `github-pages` vs. `github pages`).

### 5. Font Sizes

Since you're using Markdown, the font sizes will generally be handled by the styling of your chosen theme (e.g., Just the Docs). However, here's a general guideline for hierarchical understanding:

* **H1 (Recipe Title):** Largest font size, most prominent.
* **H2 (Major Sections):** Second largest, clearly separating main parts.
* **H3 (Sub-sections, Descriptions):** Slightly smaller, for detailed breakdowns within major sections.
* **H4+ (Further Sub-sections):** Progressively smaller, for granular details.
* **Body Text:** Standard readable font size.
* **Code Blocks:** Monospaced font for clarity.

## Standard Template for Recipes (AI & Human Friendly)

This template uses Markdown and includes "metadata" sections that AI can easily parse for classification and retrieval.

### Explanation for AI and Human Understanding:

* **Front Matter (YAML block at the top):** This structured data is easily machine-readable. AI can quickly extract the `title`, `description`, `tags`, `author`, `date`, and `version` without needing to parse the entire Markdown content. This is crucial for your AI search strategy.
* **Clear Headings (H1, H2, H3):** Markdown's heading structure inherently creates a logical hierarchy. Both humans and AI can understand the organization of the content.
* **Numbered Steps:** This format is excellent for clarity and easy following by humans. AI can also identify the sequential nature of the instructions.
* **Code Blocks:** Clearly delineated with backticks (\`\`\`), making it easy for both humans and AI to distinguish executable code from descriptive text.
* **Consistent Terminology:** Using the same terms for technologies, business cases, and concepts throughout the repository will greatly improve AI's ability to cross-reference and provide accurate search results.
* **"Problem Statement" and "Solution Overview":** These sections are vital for AI to understand the *intent* and *value proposition* of each recipe, not just the technical steps.
* **"Prerequisites":** Helps AI understand dependencies and requirements.
* **"Key Takeaways & Best Practices":** Provides AI with valuable insights and higher-level concepts derived from the recipe.
* **"Further Enhancements":** Allows AI to suggest related or more advanced topics to users.
* **"Troubleshooting & Common Issues":** Makes the recipes more practical and provides AI with valuable problem-solution pairs.

By adhering to this structure and naming convention, you'll build a highly valuable and easily searchable repository of your knowledge, accessible and understandable by both your human audience and future AI applications. Good luck with this fantastic initiative!
